# Test script to verify image cleanup functionality

echo "🧹 Testing Recipe Image Cleanup"
echo "================================="
echo
echo "✅ Removed unused migration file: migrations/002_add_recipe_images.js"
echo "✅ Removed test file: test-ai-parsing.js"  
echo "✅ Added image deletion to OpenAI service"
echo "✅ Updated recipe deletion endpoint to clean up images"
echo
echo "🎯 Image cleanup features:"
echo "  • Images are automatically deleted from Vercel Blob Storage when recipes are deleted"
echo "  • Safe fallback: if image deletion fails, recipe deletion still succeeds"
echo "  • Only attempts to delete blob URLs (production), skips local files"
echo "  • Logs cleanup actions for monitoring"
echo
echo "🧪 To test:"
echo "  1. Create a recipe and wait for image generation"
echo "  2. Delete the recipe"
echo "  3. Check server logs for image cleanup confirmation"
echo "  4. Verify image is removed from blob storage"
echo
echo "📝 Next steps:"
echo "  • Test the complete flow: create → image generates → delete → image cleaned up"
echo "  • Monitor server logs during recipe deletion"
echo "  • Consider adding bulk cleanup for orphaned images (future enhancement)"
