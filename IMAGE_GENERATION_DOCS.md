# Recipe Image Generation Implementation

## Summary
We've successfully implemented AI-powered recipe image generation for the YouFresh app without requiring database migrations for testing. Here's what was built:

## Key Features

### 1. Image Generation Service
- **Location**: `lib/openai.ts`
- **Model**: DALL-E 3 from OpenAI
- **Style**: Overhead/top-down view only (minimizes AI artifacts)
- **Storage**: Local file system in `public/recipe-images/` for development
- **Naming**: Uses user UUID + random UUID for filename uniqueness

### 2. Optimized Prompting Strategy
- **Overhead View**: Top-down perspective reduces AI generation errors
- **Clean Background**: White background for consistent, professional look
- **Minimal Elements**: No hands, utensils, or text overlays
- **Limited Ingredients**: Only uses top 3 ingredients to avoid confusion
- **Professional Style**: Restaurant-quality food photography aesthetic

### 3. Data Storage (No Migration Required)
- Images stored in existing `parsed_ingredients` JSON field
- Added helper functions in `types.ts` to extract image data
- Backwards compatible with existing recipes

### 4. Test Infrastructure
- **Test Page**: `/test-image` for manual testing
- **Test API**: `/api/recipes/test-image` for image generation testing
- **Recipe Integration**: Images automatically generated when creating new recipes
- **UI Integration**: Recipe cards now display generated images

## Testing
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test-image`
2. Enter a recipe name and ingredients
3. Click "Generate Recipe Image (Overhead View)"
4. View the generated image

## Benefits of Overhead Style
- **Fewer Artifacts**: Top-down view is more predictable for AI
- **Professional Look**: Mimics food blog and restaurant photography
- **Consistent Composition**: Easier to achieve uniform results
- **Better Recognition**: Clearer view of ingredients and plating

## Environment Setup
Make sure you have an `.env.local` file with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with Vercel Blob Storage for production
- Image optimization and compression
- Fallback to stock images if generation fails
- Batch image generation for existing recipes
